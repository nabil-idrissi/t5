    ">**Plot Observation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at the plot, we notice that the validation loss decreased during epochs 1–4, which indicates that our model was fitting the training data well during those first few epochs. However, by epochs 5, 6, and 7, the validation loss plateaued, staying in the 1.81 range. This suggests that we are nearing the turning point, where the model will stop improving on the validation set and may start to overfit—memorizing the training data rather than generalizing to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why Use ROUGE-1 Instead of Validation Loss as the Stopping Criterion?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have used **validation loss** to determine when to stop training (specifically, at the point where the validation loss is at its lowest). However, we chose to rely on **ROUGE-1** instead, as it is a better metric for assessing the **quality of the summarization**. ROUGE-1 measures the overlap between key words in the reference summary and the model's generated summary. It directly assesses the usefulness and relevance of the generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation loss** primarily measures how well the model is fitting the training data, essentially how accurately it predicts individual words or tokens. While **lower validation loss** indicates that the model is getting better at predicting words, it doesn't tell us anything about the quality of the summary. A lower validation loss doesn't necessarily mean the model is capturing important information or generating coherent, meaningful summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **ROUGE-1** evaluates how much of the important content from the original document is retained in the summary by measuring the overlap of unigrams (single words) between the reference summary and the model’s output. A higher **ROUGE-1 score** indicates better summary quality and coverage, making it a more direct measure of whether the summary is both useful and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Aligning ROUGE-1 and Validation Loss**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the **validation loss** didn't improve much over the last three epochs, and both the **ROUGE-1** score and **validation loss** aligned well around epoch 4 (when **ROUGE-1** reached its peak and **validation loss** began to plateau), we decided to save the model at this point. We will now upload it to Hugging Face and use it for comparison with the FLAN-T5 model."
